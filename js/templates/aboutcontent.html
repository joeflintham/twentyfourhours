            <h2>About 24 Hours at Jono's</h2>
            <p> 24 hours at Jono's is an audio visual documentary exploring the micro community that exists at Jono's Snooker Club in Camberwell, London. Spoken word narration, interviews, video, storytelling and live sound recordings are used to recreate the atmosphere of Jono's Snooker Club. Our aim was to highlight this micro community to a wider audience, inviting outsiders to explore a space they may not usually be a part of. </p>

            <p>This project was created as part of the Visualised Audio Fund, a Roundhouse and Ideas Tap project supporting young creatives to develop innovative work at the junction of radio, moving image, digital media and storytelling.  The fund is part of the Roundhouse's programme of creative opportunities for 11-25 year-olds.  Each year the Roundhouse helps 3,000 11-25 year-olds from all backgrounds to realise their creative potential through music, media and performing arts. Much of this work takes place in the Paul Hamlyn Roundhouse Studios - a dedicated creative centre for music and media production, broadcasting, performances and rehearsal, where young people work with industry professionals to learn and develop their skills.<br>&nbsp;<br>Find out more at <a href="http://www.roundhouse.org.uk">www.roundhouse.org.uk</a>.</p>
